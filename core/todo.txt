Next Steps to Enhance:

Add Real Shot Scale Classifier

Fine-tune DINOv2 on MovieShots dataset
Replace classify_shot_scale() stub


Character Recognition

Integrate InsightFace for face detection
Match against IMDb cast photos
Replace _extract_cast_stub()


Implement Evaluation Metrics

CIDEr calculation
CRITIC score (character accuracy)
Action Score (from Shot-by-Shot)


Thread Structure Detection

Dense feature matching (from paper)
RANSAC-based clustering


Emotion Detection

Add FER2013 model
Store in vector DB
Use in Stage I prompts



//

Embeddings normalization & pooling choice

Default: per-shot mean pooling and L2 normalize. 
If you prefer max-pooling or weighted pooling, tell me (default mean is standard).

//

Next steps I can do for you (pick any)

Run through the script and make any small edits (e.g., change MOVIE_IDENTIFIER or H5_PATH) and I’ll update the file text for you.

Add an optional NER-based character bank that extracts names from AD CSV and attaches them into characters metadata for shots.

Add evaluation code that matches generated ADs to AD CSV rows by time and computes simple overlap metrics (e.g., fraction aligned).

Add TTS generation as later step (you said secondary).

If you want, I can now:

Drop the file into the canvas for you, or

Paste the file again with any small edits you want (HDF5 path, default MOVIE_IDENTIFIER), or

Walk through running it locally and troubleshooting errors you may hit.

Which would you like me to do next?

//
Later, you can improve realism by:

Adding temporal smoothing over decoded captions (so they’re stable over adjacent shots)

Feeding a few nearest neighbor captions together into Groq for richer summaries

Weighting CLIP similarity by subtitles alignment if needed
